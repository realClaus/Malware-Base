Most of my friends, family says: Malware is not a toy to play with. However, Malwares can be fun to play with. (if u have the responsibility to maintain malwares.) You will see all of the malwares, Trojan,Fake AV, Ransomware etc in this Repository!

Im inspired by many youtubers like Enderman, Fly Tech etc in my opinion, Enderman is the one that inspired me to make this repository and my youtube Channel. The files are downloaded from Enderman's repository! be sure to check him out!
